SupernaturalRaces
=================

SupernaturalRaces is a plugin developed for NovusCraft (MC-NC.CO).
It features Races, Spells and Event classes.  Each race is highly configurable and can have multiple skills and events
attached to it.  Each player starts out as a Human which is a representation of the Player class from Bukkit.
Players then have the option of converting to another type of class with the /convert command.
